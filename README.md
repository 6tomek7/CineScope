# Angular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.0.

## Project Description

This project is a website that allows users to search for movies, add them to favorites, and rate them. The homepage displays the most popular movies, TV shows, and actors of the moment. Users can click on an avatar to view detailed information. Additionally, the platform includes a user profile section and supports login via Facebook or Google. The application integrates with The Movie Database API (TMDb) for data retrieval.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
